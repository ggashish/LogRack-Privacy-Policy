# *LogRack Privacy Policy*
### By using LogRack you agree with its privacy policy.

## 1. What data do we store?

 1. `guild_id`: We store `guild_id` for bot funtionality and features.
 2. `user_id`: We store `user_id` in guild's CPL (Control Panel Logs) and logging ignore data.
 3. `channel_id`: We store `channel_id`for our logging in order to send log there.
 4. `roles_id`: We store `role_id` for logging ignore data.
 5. `webhook`: We only store `webhook` if the guild have enabled webhook logging in their server.

## 2. Where does you store your data?
We store your data on our VPS (Virtual Private Server) on PostgreSQL to store all the bot's data.

## 3. Who all have access to the data?
All the guild's data can we viewed by the guild's mods and the bot's owner have access to the data and can modify it anytime.

## 4. How can I get rid of the data stored?
You cannot get rid of data if logging is enabled in our server, but it you still would like to get rid of your data you can either delete logging on you server by using command `+log delete` or kick the bot from your server.

## 5. I'm questioning why do you need all this data, and this Privacy Policy doesn't answer my question. What should I do?
